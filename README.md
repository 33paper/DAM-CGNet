# DAM-CGNet: Semantic Segmentation-Based Approach for Valley-Bottom Extraction

This repository contains the implementation of **DAM-CGNet**, a deep learning model for extracting valley bottoms from **digital elevation models (DEMs)** using semantic segmentation.

> âš  **Note:** This repository currently includes partial code. The full implementation, including training scripts and dataset preprocessing, will be released upon paper acceptance.

## Requirements

To run this code, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- Python **3.8.2**
- PyTorch **1.7.2** with CUDA support
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA (for training)
- Other dependencies (to be provided in `README` in the full release)


## Code Availability

- The current release includes the **model code**.
- Training scripts, dataset preprocessing, and additional utilities will be added after **paper acceptance**.
